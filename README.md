While owning an electric car everyone always asks if I really save money. And I never know the answer to that, I always say yes. So hopefully this will show if I actually save money.

The price per kwh is what I took from my electric bill
The other charge price is one that I made up for now.

The average gas price and the average mpg is a result from google.
