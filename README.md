While owning an electric car everyone always asks if I really save money. And I never know the answer to that, I always say yes. So hopefully this will show if I actually save money.

The price per kwh is what I took from my electric bill
The other charge price is one that I made up for now since I don't charge away from home a lot, will update that when I do charge away from home.

The average gas price and the average mpg is a result from google. 

This has become more of a project than I had originally planned

- [x] add a map
- [x] use api to add charging stations
- [ ] i don't know yet. want to add more.
- [ ] on going, keep updating the information.
- [ ] charge away from home.

## so far the findings show that I do save more, just by charging at home. I also get $7.50 taken off my electic bill monthly from the electric company to charge my car in non-peak periods.
